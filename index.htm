    <!---a "link" refers to an element that allows you to connect or hyperlink one web page or resource to another. 
Links are an essential part of the web, as they enable navigation between different pages, websites, and online
 resources. They are often represented as clickable text, images, or other elements on a web page.

The HTML <a> element, which stands for "anchor," is used to create links. 
    Here's a basic example of how an <a> element is used to create a link-->





    <h1>Home page</h1>
    
    <a href="http://ujuzifursaafrica.com/">Click Me</a>
    
    <a href="links_images.htm">Mywebsite</a>
